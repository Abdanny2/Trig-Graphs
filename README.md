 Sine and Cosine Graphs

This program allow the user to generate a sine or a cosine graph by only asking the user for the graph properties. 

The properties of the sine and cosine function are:
- Amplitude : Any real number different than 0
- Period: Any real number different than 0 and often a multiple of pi
- Phase shift: Any real number which represent the horizontal shift of the graph
- Vertical shift: Vertical shift of the graph and could be any real number

The user have to be familiar with the sine and cosine function to use this program
